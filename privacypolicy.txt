Sleeper+ Privacy Policy
Last updated: November 15, 2025

Sleeper+ is a free Chrome extension that adds quality-of-life improvements to the Sleeper fantasy football website. We respect your privacy and keep the extension simple so you can enjoy Sleeper without worrying about additional tracking.

Data Collection
- We do not collect, log, sell, or transmit any personal data about you or your leagues.
- All preferences you set (league IDs, layout options, trend toggles, etc.) are stored locally via Chrome's storage APIs and remain on your device.
- Player and league information is fetched directly from Sleeper's public API endpoints solely to render the requested overlays. Those requests go straight from your browser to Sleeper; they are never proxied through servers we control.

Data Sharing
- We do not share data with advertisers, analytics providers, or third parties.
- The extension does not inject additional cookies, pixels, or telemetry scripts beyond what Sleeper already serves.

Contact
If you have privacy questions or requests, please open an issue in the Sleeper+ repository or reach out via the listing page. We'll respond as quickly as possible.
